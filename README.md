Patricia's Frogger Arcade Game
===============================
#### Welcome to the Frogger Game! Are you ready to start a new adventure looking for stars while running away from giant ladybugs? Let's go!!

#### But first, some important inscructions:

* The goal of the game is to increase your score as much as possible.

* You increase your score by moving the character to the lake and/or collecting Stars.

* Use the arrow keys or the "WASD" keys on your keyboard to move the character (up, left, down, right).

* Every time your character reaches the lake, the difficulty of the game will increase (enemies will go faster).

* If you collide with any enemies, you will die.

#### Good luck!
